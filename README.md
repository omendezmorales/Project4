# Project4
This is the repo for Project  4  of Udacity's  [Nano Degree on  Data Analytics Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).
The project is about [data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) in a methodic and systematic way:
1. *Gather*. Depending on the source of your data, and what format it's in, the steps in gathering data vary.
High-level gathering process: obtaining data (downloading a file from the internet, scraping a web page, querying an API, etc.) and importing that data into a programming environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook)
2. *Assess*. Assess data for:
    * Quality: issues with content. Low quality data is also known as dirty data.
    * Tidiness: issues with structure that prevent easy analysis. Untidy data is also known as messy data. Tidy data requirements:
      - Each variable forms a column.
      - Each observation forms a row.
      - Each type of observational unit forms a table.
3. *Clean*. Both Manual (not recommended unless the issues are single occurrences) and/or Programmatic.
